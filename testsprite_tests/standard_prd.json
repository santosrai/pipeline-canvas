  "product_overview": "The HTTP Request node allows users to create, configure, and execute HTTP/HTTPS requests to any RESTful API or web service within a visual protein engineering pipeline workflow. It supports comprehensive request setup including method selection, URL templating, authentication, headers, query parameters, and request body management, with detailed response visualization and error handling.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable users to execute HTTP requests with various methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS) within pipeline workflows.",
    "Support dynamic configuration using template variables for URLs, headers, query parameters, and request body.",
    "Provide multiple authentication schemes including none, Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and custom headers.",
    "Offer rich request output including detailed status, headers, body, and error display within an integrated output panel.",
    "Ensure robust error handling with full response visibility and actionable error messages.",
    "Seamlessly integrate with the existing pipeline execution engine for consistent data flow and logging."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "HTTP Method Selector with support for common HTTP verbs and defaulting to POST.",
    "Dynamic URL configuration supporting absolute and relative URLs with live validation and template variables.",
    "Multiple authentication methods including Basic Auth, Bearer Token, Custom Header, and API Key support.",
    "Comprehensive headers and query parameters management with toggle, JSON editor, dynamic templating, and encoding.",
    "Flexible request body configuration supporting JSON, Form Data, Form URL Encoded, Raw text, and template expressions.",
    "Advanced options including timeout, follow redirects, SSL verification, and flexible response format selection.",
    "Detailed output panel displaying execution status, request/response headers and bodies, with multiple views including table, JSON, and schema.",
    "Error handling features displaying error messages, network and HTTP error details, and retry suggestions.",
    "Integration of template variable support (`{{input.*}}`, `{{config.*}}`) with real-time validation.",
    "Execution engine integration capturing full request and response details for logging and debugging."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User drags and drops the HTTP Request node onto the pipeline canvas to add a new node.",
    "User selects the HTTP method from a dropdown in the node configuration panel.",
    "User configures the request URL, entering absolute or relative URLs and using template variables as needed, with live validation feedback.",
    "User chooses an authentication type and inputs credentials or tokens as required.",
    "User configures optional headers and query parameters using toggles and JSON editors, supporting dynamic data via templates.",
    "User sets up the request body if applicable, selecting content type and specification method including JSON input or expressions.",
    "User adjusts advanced options like timeout, SSL verification, and response format according to need.",
    "User executes the node, triggering the HTTP request through the pipeline execution engine.",
    "User views the output panel that presents request execution status, HTTP status code, detailed request and response data, and parsed response views (table, JSON, schema).",
    "If errors occur, user examines error messages and details presented in the output panel and takes corrective actions.",
    "User optionally copies, downloads, or exports response data and configures retry or chaining logic for complex workflows in future releases."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users can select and successfully execute requests with all supported HTTP methods.",
    "URLs support both absolute and relative formats with template variable resolution and validation.",
    "Authentication workflows including Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and custom headers work as intended.",
    "Headers and query parameters accept valid JSON input with template variables and are included correctly in requests.",
    "Request bodies are sent as per configured content types and specifications, accurately reflecting template expressions.",
    "Output panel consistently displays request method, URL, headers, query parameters, request body, response status, headers, body, and execution time.",
    "Errors including network issues and HTTP error responses show full response body and actionable error messages in the output panel.",
    "Template variable syntax and substitution works across all configurable fields with real-time validation.",
    "The node integrates with the pipeline execution engine to log execution details and supports chaining response data to subsequent nodes.",
    "Request timeout, follow redirects, SSL verification, and response parsing options operate correctly according to user settings."
